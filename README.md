## Project Management

We will be using a Github Project with 3 sections: Backlog, In Progress, and Done. Issues in the Backlog will represent segments of work to get done, or problems that need to be fixed. 

To contribute to the project, assign an issue in the Backlog to yourself and move it to the In Progress section. Create a new branch off of main and implement the feature/fix/improvement, making commits after completing each subsection of the work. Push your code and move the issue(s) it adresses to Done. Create a pull request (PR) into main with a [closing keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) in the description referencing the issue(s) that are addressed.
